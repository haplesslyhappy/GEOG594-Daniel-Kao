# I think Big Data is information collected on a large scale, and then processed to give useful results based on trends, projected results, and many more application. Because the scale of the data processed is so large, the information cannot be processed using traditional means, as computers simply don't have the capacity to do so much work. The advantages of big data are that they give an immense amount of data points to give a much more complete answer in statistical questions. Despite the enormous advantages of big data, it needs much work because it is often hard to reach and has incomplete structure. One way these drawbacks are being rectified is the ability to train artificial intelligence to organize information. Because of this, big data is not only characterized by the volume of data being used, but also the ways in which the data is processed. The processing of big data is often characterized with algorithms, machine learning, and incredibly speed because of its scale. Big data is immensely useful to many aspects, such as research, advertisement, health care, and money management. Big data is a subject constantly changing and needs new and creative ideas to keep up with the pace of technology.
